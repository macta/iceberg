Welcome to the Iceberg wiki!

Monticello is a simple but powerful distributed versioning system that has been the default code versioning system for several flavors of Smalltalk for around 20 years. In the past decade, newer distributing versioning systems such as Git and Mercurial have become outrageously popular and, although Monticello still has lots of fans, there is an increasing consensus in the community about the convenience of taking advantage of those modern versioning systems. While there exist a few tools that allow to commit Smalltalk code into such code repositories (most frequently: git), none of them has reached the maturity to replace Monticello.
