Welcome to the Iceberg wiki!

Monticello is a simple but powerful distributed version control system that has been the default code versioning mechanism for many flavors of Smalltalk for around 20 years. In the past decade, newer distributing version vcontrol systems such as Git and Mercurial have become extremely popular and, although Monticello still has lots of fans and is very functional, there is an increasing view in the community that we should leverage the convenience of these modern versioning systems. While there are several tools that already allow Smalltalk code to be committed into such code repositories (most frequently: git), none of them has yet reached the maturity to replace Monticello. Iceberg is an active project to bring these ideas together and fix this for Smalltalk!
