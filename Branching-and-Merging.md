# Basic Branching and Merging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBzkjwABPEI

This video shows in a simple example how to branch, merge and checkout different commits.
In this video we first create a new class with a method, then we create another branch and force a conflict. We resolve the conflict during merge.

In the middle, bonus feature, we checked out a commit and stayed in Detached HEAD for a while ;)
